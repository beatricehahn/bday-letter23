                It all seems to fly by quicker with each iteration, doesn’t it? <br />
                But the one great thing about time moving quickly is that
                I see and hear snapshots of your life and they are flipping by
                like a little animation presenting a story within a story.

                I don’t know what it is about our friendship that works,
                as it seems like it is suspended in a bubble outside of regular time <br />
                because I never feel like I stray too far from being close at heart
                when I need saving. <br />

            <p>
                As if our friendship is a lone boat out in the ocean far away <br />
                That appears within arm’s reach when I’m being washed out by the ocean. <br />
                And once we begin talking again it feels as if the boat has been right there always.

                Or like a piece of wood that gets rained on so one would think it would be cold,  damp, and difficult to spark, <br />
                But it’s core is always warm in the same way that you have always been kind, <br />
                genuine, and there for me when I felt cold, stiff, and alone. <br />
                Reaching out to you never felt awkward or difficult
                even after a large amount of chronological time had passed. <br />
                Even though I already valued our friendship deeply before, 
                I’ve learned to cherish it more as I grew older.

                I am thankful for your existence and my friendship with you. <br />
                I wish that 2024 unfolds with many happy memories that overpower any sadness. <br />
                It would be an honor to continue being a piece in your life and hear more
                about your dreams and career milestones.

                And while memories pass and go my mind all the time, <br />
                Even if some become fuzzy, <br />
                Even if I may forget our exact conversations <br />
                And the exact experiences we had in person <br />
                I understand that my respect for you is etched well <br />
                And will endure all the storms that may blow.<br />
